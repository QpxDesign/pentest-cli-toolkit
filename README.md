### Pentest CLI Toolkit

#### An opensoure toolkit of bash/python commands to run checks on public facing IPs and Websites

#### Setup

Install python package dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt` (none yet, but may add some)

I recommend adding each of these as aliases in your terminal (see [tutorial](https://wpbeaches.com/make-an-alias-in-bash-or-zsh-shell-in-macos-with-terminal/)), like this:
`alias open_ports='python3 /path/to/dir/open.ports.py`

you can copy/paste all these aliases from the alias.txt file.

#### Dependencies

telnet - [installation guide](https://webhostinggeeks.com/howto/how-to-install-telnet-on-windows-macos-linux/)

#### Currently Implemented Commands

`locate_ip.sh <ip_or_domain>` - geolocate IP address to get location and ISP information

`open_ports.py <ip_or_domain>` - check to see if common ports for dns/ssh/ftp/http/etc are open or not using telnet
